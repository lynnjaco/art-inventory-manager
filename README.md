Art Store Inventory Manager
===========================

Welcome to the Art Store Inventory Manager! This project provides a web-based interface for managing the inventory of an art store.

Features
--------

*   **Add New Product**: Easily add new products to the inventory with details like name, image, base price, product options, and description.  Each product option has a base price built into the function to calculate its final price, after applying the selected price multiplier.
    (Small Canvas - $20 | Medum Canvas - $40 | Large Canvas - $60 | Small Photo - $10 | Medium Photo - $20 | Large Photo - $30 | Original - $110)  
    Artwork usually has different levels of complexity, so the user has the option to set the multiplier according to their own parameters.
*   **Preview Product Specifications**: Preview the details of the product being added before submission, including image, price, and description.  
*   **Manage Current Inventory**: View and manage the current inventory of products.  Products added to the inventory list with no product quantites will display an "out of stock" alert.  if product is added to inventory with a total quantity of less than 20, a "Low Stock" alert will display.
